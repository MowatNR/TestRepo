Computer Programming 3, 
Math 4, 
Statistics 4, 
Machine Learning 2, 
Domain Expertise 1 Fresh out of College and still working on this one, 
Communication and Presentation skills 3,
Data Visualization 4. 
During this program I expect to improve the most in computer programming and machine learning. 
I think I will improve my communication skills during this course. 
I have a strong background in statistics and data visualization, but I'm relatively weak in programming languages like Python and SQL. 
I would also like to improve in, and gain a domain expertise that is deeper than the broad academics I have been immersed in the last few years.
